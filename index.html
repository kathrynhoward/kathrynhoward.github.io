<section class="About">
  <h2>about me.</h2>
<h4>
    I am a technical recruiter living here in Toronto. I strive to thoroughly understand the needs and desires of my candidates to ultimately guide them into amazing next steps that advance their career and encourage their passion for technology. I work at
    <a href="http://www.sagerecruiting.me/"target="_blank">Sage</a>, a boutique recruiting company that focuses on niche development positions in the emerging technology space. Originally from Chicago, I have a passion for exploring new places and cultures. Other than working and traveling, I love to bake everything and anything, including taste testing of course. ;) Check out my recipes of the month and give them a try!

  <h2>recruitment done right.</h2>
  <h4>
    “The recruitment process includes analyzing the requirements of a job, attracting employees to that job, screening and selecting applicants, hiring, and integrating the new employee to the organization” (Business Dictionary). Logistically, this definition is accurate, but often times life isn’t always logical. Real recruitment involves a lot more than just the logistics. Career moves are exciting, scary, and often nerve-wracking next steps that need more attention and care than “just the logistics.” So many recruiters bypass the humanistic aspect involved with career moves and that is where recruitment is done wrong.
  <br>
    I love recruitment because I love watching people grow their skills, achieve their goals, and afford nicer things than they could the year before. Recruitment is about people and in order to make sure this process is done right these people must be listened to and treated with respect. Luckily, I recruit in an industry where people are just as passionate about their work as I am and forming long-term relationships with candidates in the IT industry has allowed me to learn more and more everyday about the ever-changing world of tech, hence my new hobby!
